*This blog is a collection of the many trends, ideas, and practices I've encountered that have had an impact
on me as an engineer. It is a means of distilling information and presenting what I consider to be the most important 
aspects of software engineering.*

Here we go. Here's yet another tech blog. Is it a day that ends in "y?"

Yes, I'm here to write about tech and software. Fortunately/unfortunately for whoever is reading, my goal isn't to
discuss the latest Javascript framework or explain why I think tool A is better than tool B. I think there's plenty of people
out there that spend enough time on those topics. I want to spend the majority of this blog exploring concepts that
may otherwise seem impractical.

Reading content-rich books like Robert Martin's *[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)*
is one thing but applying what you've just read into a project is a stretch. Where would you begin? What are the most
important issues to tackle first? Books provide chapter-by-chapter explanations with code examples but no recipe on
sensibly applying them to a production-grade application. What I aim to do is detail real-life instances of how I've used 
certain practices in my career and the design tradeoffs that have come with it. This means in each post I'll analyze
a use case and come up with a basic end-to-end solution. At the very least, anyone reading should be able to use these 
solutions as a guiding template.

I do plan on sometimes writing about other topics as well. From career growth to my own experiences with certain tools (I said 
I wouldn't 2 paragraphs ago but I can't resist), I hope to make tech more accessible to anyone willing to learn. Sometimes
software engineering seems like tutorial-hell, but it simply comes down to our ability to differentiate what is important
from what is noise.

These posts are also a way for me to go back and compare my current beliefs against what I thought in the past.
I've re-prioritized certain aspects of building software a few times over the last 5 years, so I hope writing
will help me track changes in how I evaluate the discipline overall.

If you've stuck around, welcome! It's going to be an exciting journey of building things that impact the world! ☺️
