*This blog is a collection of the many trends, ideas, and practices I've encountered that have had an impact
on me as an engineer. It is a means of distilling information and presenting what I consider to be the most important 
aspects of software engineering.*

Here we go. Here's yet another tech blog. Is it a day that ends in "y?"

Yes, I'm here to write about tech and software. Fortunately/unfortunately for whoever is reading, my goal is not to
discuss the latest Javascript framework or explain why I think tool A is better than tool B. I think there are plenty of people
out there that spend enough time on those topics. I want to spend the majority of this blog exploring concepts that
may otherwise seem impractical.

Reading books like Robert Martin's *[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)*
is one thing but applying what you've learned into an actual codebase reinforces those concepts and lets you think
beyond your projects. Most books provide simple chapter-by-chapter explanations and code examples. What I aim to do
is to detail real-life instances of how I've used certain practices in my career and the design tradeoffs
that have come with it. Often this means analyzing a use case and then coming up with a basic end-to-end solution. At
the very least, someone should be able to use these solutions as a guiding template.

These posts are also a way for me to go back and compare my current beliefs against what I thought in the past.
I've re-prioritized certain aspects of building software a few times over the past 5 years so I hope this will measure
the maturity of how I evaluate the discipline overall.

So welcome! I hope you'll join me on this journey of building things that impact the world ☺️
