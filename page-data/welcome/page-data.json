It is a means of distilling information and presenting what I consider to be the most important\naspects of software engineering.</em></p>\n<p>Here we go. Here's yet another tech blog. Is it a day that ends in \"y?\"</p>\n<p>Yes, I'm here to write about tech and software. Fortunately/unfortunately for whoever is reading, my goal is not to\ndiscuss the latest Javascript framework or explain why I think tool A is better than tool B. I think there are plenty of people\nout there that spend enough time on those topics. I want to spend the majority of this blog exploring concepts that\nmay otherwise seem impractical.</p>\n<p>Reading books like Robert Martin's <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882\">Clean Code</a></em>\nis one thing but applying what you've learned into an actual codebase reinforces those concepts and lets you think\nbeyond your projects. Most books provide simple chapter-by-chapter explanations and code examples. What I aim to do\nis to detail real-life instances of how I've used certain practices in my career and the design tradeoffs\nthat have come with it. Often this means analyzing a use case and then coming up with a basic end-to-end solution. At\nthe very least, someone should be able to use these solutions as a guiding template.</p>\n<p>These posts are also a way for me to go back and compare my current beliefs against what I thought in the past.\nI've re-prioritized certain aspects of building software a few times over the past 5 years so I hope this will measure\nthe maturity of how I evaluate the discipline overall.</p>\n<p>So welcome! I hope you'll join me on this journey of building things that impact the world ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome to My Blog","date":"December 09, 2023","description":"This blog is a collection of the many trends, ideas, and practices I've encountered that have had an impact on me as an engineer.
